# A python script to recompress files in other compression formats
I wanted to recompress .rar files into .tar.xz, so I made a small script to do this

## How to use
Run the script with python3. Enter an input folder containing .rar, .zip, .tar, .gz, .bz2 files. Enter an output folder for the newly compressed .tar.xz files.
- This script requires xz
